Hello! My name is Uwase Harelimana Albine. I am currently studying Transportation Engineering at the University of Rwanda and pursuing a Data Science track at ALX. I am passionate about using technology and sustainable practices to make real-world impact.

In my free time, I enjoy working on community-building projects and volunteering. Iâ€™m excited to begin my GitHub journey to showcase my projects, collaborate with others, and grow my programming and data science skills!
