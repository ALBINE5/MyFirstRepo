My name is Uwase Harelimana Albine, a passionate and goal-oriented student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Transportation Engineering at the University of Rwanda. I am also enrolled in the ALX Data Science program, where I have completed certifications in Virtual Assistance, AI Career Essentials, and Professional Foundations. My academic journey is driven by a strong interest in sustainable development, innovation, and social impact, particularly in the areas of transportation, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability.

Beyond academics, I actively participate in community development through initiatives like Urugerero, and I’ve gained recognition for impactful projects, such as ranking second nationally in a renewable energy-based water purification competition organized by AIMS. I am a determined individual who values teamwork, learning, and leadership, with aspirations to serve globally—especially through opportunities like UN Volunteering and programs that foster inclusive development.
